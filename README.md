<h1>Credit Card Fraud Detection System</h1>
<h2>Introducion</h2>
<p>Aim is to prepare a model using the concepts of data science, that is capable of assessing the credit card transaction datasheets for any potential frauds. </p>
<h2>Application Used</h2>
<p>Here, I have used <strong>Thonny</strong> application to write my code. Thonny is a free and open-source integrated development environment for Python and downloading it is as a easy as it is to pronounce its name.<br><a href="https://thonny.org/"><Strong>Click here to install the application</Strong></a><br> There are many other applications to run the code such as Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Replit, Jupyter Notebooks,etc.  </p>
<h2>Language Used</h2>
<p>There are two main langauges in the world of Data Science, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong>. Python is a general and multifield coding language where as R is   a scientific langauge. I have used Python langauge to write my code.</p>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>Dataset can be taken from the Kaggle website.Kaggle is a data science competition platform and online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners under Google LLC. Here  I am here adding the link for the dataset that I have used. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection"><strong>Click here to download the dataset.</strong></a></p><br><br>
The dataset is converted into a non-readable form by using another data science concept called as principal component analysis; as the data is sensitive.
<h2>Libraries Used </h2>
<ol><li><strong>Pandas</strong>- Imported as <strong>pd</strong>. This library is important for reading the <strong>CSV(Comma Seperated Values</strong>file.</li>
<li><strong>Scikit-Learn</strong>-scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It is denoted as <strong>sklearn.</strong> <ul><li><strong></strong>sklearn.model_selection</strong>this model allows to split the dataset into train and test data.</li>
  <li><strong>sklearn.linear_model</strong>allows to import the logistic regression model which I will be explaining later on.  </li>
  <li><Strong>sklearn.metrics</Strong>The 
 metrics</Strong> model allows to assess the quality of your model.</ul></li></ol>.
<h2>Concept Used </h2>
<P><strong>LogisticRegression</strong>-This type of statistical model (also known as logit model) is often used for classification and predictive analytics. Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn't vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables.
<br><br>This model is mostly used when the data available is in binary form.</P>
